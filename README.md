**Courses Completed:**
This repository showcases my assignments and projects from two Coursera courses offered by the **University of California, Santa Cruz** as part of the *Coding for Everyone: C and C++ Specialization*:

- **C for Everyone: Programming Fundamentals**  
  Covered foundational topics such as introduction to C, lexical elements, data types, control flow, functions, recursion, arrays, and pointers.

- **C for Everyone: Structured Programming**  
  Built upon the fundamentals with advanced concepts including enums, structs, linked lists, binary trees, file I/O, command-line arguments, and an introduction to C++ constructs.

##  Projects & Assignments

| File                          | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `7-Card.c`                    | 🃏 Simulates 7-card poker hands and computes probabilities of hand types using Monte Carlo simulations. |
| `Fix-2nfMistake.c`            | Corrected normalization mistake in database design assignment. |
| `Fix-D.P-s-mistake.c`         | Debugged dynamic programming error. |
| `avg-meth-2.c`                | 🐘 Computes the average weight of elephant seals using a predefined array of integer weights. |
| `avg-weight-eleph.c`          | 🐘 Reads elephant seal weights from a file, counts them, and computes the average weight. |
| `bst_inorder_from_file.c`     | 🌳 Reads integers from a file, inserts them into a binary search tree, and prints sorted values using inorder traversal. |
| `employee_generator.c`        | 👥 Generates a list of employees with random salaries and departments using structs and enums. |
| `int-RS-DoubleList.c`         | 🔗 Doubly linked list: generate 200 random integers [0–49], remove duplicates, and print before/after. Demonstrates bidirectional traversal, dynamic memory, and duplicate removal. |
| `int-random-store.c`          |🔗 Generate 100 random integers, store them in a linked list, sort with Bubble Sort, and display in rows of 5. Demonstrates dynamic memory, list traversal, and sorting.|
| `poem.c`                      | Printed a formatted poem (string and I/O practice). |
| `ratio_sum_avg.c`             | 📘 Rational Numbers in C: structs, file I/O, arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide), reduce fractions with GCD, compute sum & average. |
| `sin-gen.c`                   |🔢 Computes the sine of a user-input value between 0 and 1 using `math.h`. Includes input validation and floating-point operations. |
| `vals-sin-cos.c`              | 📊 Generates a table of sine and cosine values for x from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1 using `math.h`. |
| `README.md`                   | Repository overview. |
